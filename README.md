# Artbot Creative Banner

A dynamic product carousel banner built for Artbot Creative's test task.

## Project Brief

### Artbot Creative Banner Task
**Format:** 300x600

### Description
The banner will feature a product carousel accompanied by relevant titles. Please refer to the example screenshot for the desired appearance, as this is a test task we are not looking for pixel perfect solutions hence why we haven't sent any figma designs. All necessary fonts and imagery assets are located in the assets folder.

Upon completion, push the work to your GitHub versioning control workspace and share with:
**zain.mughal@artbot.io**

### Animation
The creative will start with the first product and title. After 1.5 seconds, the subsequent product and title will fade in. This pattern continues for all 4 products before looping. The animation should be executed using GSAP.

### Functionality
- The carousel should auto-play upon loading
- If the user interacts with the arrows, they will control the image transitions (images will fade in and out)
- Interaction with the arrows should also update the product title accordingly
- Follow the animation mock-up reference attached

### Product Titles
1. Micro Bags
2. Small Check Merino Wool Scarf
3. Mini Alexa in Amethyst
4. Medium Lily in Sapphire

## Technical Requirements

- **Dimensions:** 300x600 pixels
- **Animation Library:** GSAP
- **Auto-play:** 1.5 second intervals
- **Transitions:** Fade in/out effects
- **User Controls:** Arrow navigation
- **Looping:** Continuous carousel rotation
